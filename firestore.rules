/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Caissa Chess
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private user data,
 *  allows public read access to certain collections, and uses denormalization to ensure
 *  authorization independence.
 * @data_structure The data is organized into several top-level collections: `users`, `divisions`,
 *  `matches`, `tournaments`, `skins`, and `tasks`. User-specific data is nested under `/users/{userId}`.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *  - Users can only access their own data under `/users/{userId}`.
 *  - Listing of users is disallowed.
 *  - Public read access is granted to the `divisions`, `skins`, and `tasks` collections.
 * @denormalization Authorization decisions rely on denormalized data within documents.
 *  For example, `matches` documents contain `player1Id` and `player2Id` to avoid needing to fetch user documents.
 * @structural_segregation Public data (e.g., `divisions`) is stored in separate collections from private user data (e.g., `/users/{userId}`).
